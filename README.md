Outdated!
=========

Please see https://github.com/KSP-KOS/EditorTools for much more up-to-date and better version. As such, I won't maintain this anymore.


kOS-Sublime
===========

Simple [Sublime 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) plugin to ease in creation of
[KerboScript](https://github.com/erendrake/KOS) files used by kOS in the most awesome thing known as [Kerbal Space Program](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com). It highlights most of the keywords / control structures and offers some completions as well.

Usage
=====

Clone repo & copy kos.* files under Packages/User in your Sublime directory.
